# Two-Finger Pinch-to-Zoom Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of two-finger pinch-to-zoom functionality for the whiteboard component in MindViz.

## Changes Made

### 1. InteractionLayer.ts
Added comprehensive two-finger zoom support to the `InteractionLayer` class:

#### New State Properties
- `pinchStartDist: number | null` - Stores the initial distance between two fingers
- `pinchStartZoom: number` - Stores the zoom level when pinch begins
- `pinchStartCenter: Point` - Stores the center point between two fingers
- `pinchRafId: number | null` - RequestAnimationFrame ID for throttling
- `lastPinchEvent: TouchEvent | null` - Stores the last pinch event for throttling

#### New Methods
- `handlePinchMove()` - Handles the pinch gesture and applies zoom/pan transformations
- `getTouchesDistance(touches: TouchList)` - Calculates distance between two touch points
- `getTouchesCenter(touches: TouchList)` - Calculates the center point between two touches

#### Modified Touch Event Handlers
- `onTouchStart()` - Detects two-finger touch and initializes pinch state
- `onTouchMove()` - Detects two-finger movement and throttles zoom updates
- `onTouchEnd()` - Resets pinch state when fingers are lifted

## Implementation Details

### Zoom Behavior
- **Min Zoom**: 0.1x (10%)
- **Max Zoom**: 5x (500%)
- **Throttling**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth performance
- **Center Point**: Zooms towards the center point between the two fingers
- **Pan Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts pan to keep the pinch center stable

### Touch Event Flow
1. User places two fingers on the screen → `onTouchStart` detects and initializes pinch state
2. User moves fingers together/apart → `onTouchMove` throttles and schedules zoom updates
3. `handlePinchMove` calculates new zoom level and adjusts viewport
4. User lifts fingers → `onTouchEnd` resets pinch state

### Performance Optimizations
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to throttle zoom updates (60 FPS max)
- Prevents default touch behaviors to avoid conflicts
- Cancels animation frames on touch end to prevent memory leaks
- Only processes pinch events when `enableZooming` option is true

## Usage

The two-finger zoom is automatically enabled when:
1. The whiteboard is initialized with `enableZooming: true` (default)
2. User uses two fingers on a touch-capable device
3. The gesture is performed on the whiteboard canvas

### Example
```typescript
const wb = new VisualWhiteboard(container, board, {
  enableZooming: true,  // Two-finger zoom enabled
  enablePanning: true,
  // ... other options
});
```

## Testing

To test the two-finger zoom:
1. Open `test-whiteboard.html` on a touch-capable device
2. Place two fingers on the whiteboard canvas
3. Pinch fingers together to zoom out
4. Spread fingers apart to zoom in
5. The zoom should be smooth and centered on the pinch point

## Consistency with MindMap

The implementation follows the same pattern used in `visualMindmap.ts`:
- Same helper method names (`getTouchesDistance`, `getTouchesCenter`)
- Similar throttling approach with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Similar zoom clamping logic
- Similar event handler structure

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add inertia/momentum for smooth zoom out after gesture ends
- Add haptic feedback on zoom limits
- Add visual feedback during pinch gesture
- Support rotation gesture (two-finger twist)
